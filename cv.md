## About me

I work as an IT reruiter, in my work I often encounter developers and code, and I dream of taking the place of those candidates with whom I conduct interviews. That is why I want to write code at the next place of work. So, I'm a junior front-end developer. I love the front, as I am a visual by nature, I love to see the result of my work. I am sure that if you really strive for something, everything will definitely work out.

Today I am already familiar with the basics of front-end development: I know HTML, CSS, basic JavaScript and move towards learning the framework. I chose React for study
